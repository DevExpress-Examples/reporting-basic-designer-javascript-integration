# How to Perform the JavaScript Report Designer Integration (with npm or Yarn package managers)

This example demonstrates how to integrate the [End-User Web Report Designer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103) in JavaScript application based on the server-side model.

This example is created by performing the steps described in the [Basic Report Designer Integration (with npm or Yarn package managers)](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/401256) document.

This example consists of two parts:Â 

- A server (back-end)Â ASP.NET MVC project that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements a custom web report storage.

- Report Designer front-end client JavaScript application.

Perform the following steps to run this example:

1. Open the back-end project solution (**CS\ServerSide.sln**) in Visual Studio and run the project.
2. Navigate to the **JS\ClientSide** folder that is the client part's root folder.
3. Open the console and run the following command:
    - if you have the **npm** package manager:

        ```npm install```
    - if you have the **Yarn** package manager:
        
        ```yarn install```    

4. Host the client-side part ( **JS\ClientSide** folder ) on the web server. You can add a new web site in the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
5. Launch the browser and open the web site created in the previous step.
